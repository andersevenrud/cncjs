In this document, I'll try to explain the file format which Command & Conquer 
and Red Alert use for storing various fonts.

I can't guarantee the information given here is correct. There may be things 
which are wrong - if you know something is incorrect, contact me so that
I can update this document. Also, sorry if all this sounds too complicated,
but I'm not very good at explaining things.


IMPORTANT:
 There is a major difference (concerning the previous version of this doc)
 in how the fonts are displayed. The procedure I described in the first
 version of this document is WRONG. Here, I will explain the correct
 procedure. Therefore, you should consider the first release of the document
 to be obsolete now. Sorry for the inconvenience...


The fonts used in C&C and Red Alert are proportional fonts, which means every
character can have a different width (in pixels).

The format of the FNT file header is as follows:

struct FNTHeader
{
 word fsize;    /* Size of the file              */
 word unknown1; /* Unknown entry (always 0x0500) */
 word unknown2; /* Unknown entry (always 0x000e) */
 word unknown3; /* Unknown entry (always 0x0014) */
 word wpos;     /* Offset of char. widths array  (abs. from beg. of file) */
 word cdata;    /* Offset of char. graphics data (abs. from beg. of file) */
 word hpos;     /* Offset of char. heights array (abs. from beg. of file) */
 word unknown4; /* Unknown entry (always 0x1012) */
 word nchars;   /* Number of characters in font minus 1                   */
 byte height;   /* Font height                   */
 byte maxw;     /* Max. character width          */
}

The entries unknown1, unknown2, unknown3 can be used to identify the file
as a FNT, as well as to help locate the fonts in Red Alert 
(hex signature: 00 05 0e 00 14 00).

Following the header comes an array of words that point to each character's
graphics (absolute from start of file). There are nchars+1 of these entries.

Next, there is an array of bytes that contain widths (in pixels) of each
character. There are nchars+1 entries in the array. The wpos entry in the
header points to the beginning of this array.
I'll refer to this array as wchar[].

The packed 4-bit character graphics follow after these arrays.

At the end of the file, after the graphics, another word array is located. 
Its offset is stored in hpos entry of the header. The array has nchars+1
entries. I'll refer to this array as hchar[].

Each word entry in hchar[] contains 2 values - the height of the character
graphic located in the hi-byte and the Y position of the graphic in the 
character cell located in the lo-byte. 

The character cell for character cn is a bitmap with width=wchar[cn]
and height=hchar[cn]/256 + (hchar[cn] & 256). 

The character graphic for every character is of the same width
as that character's cell, but can be of different height, depending on the 
hi-byte of the corresponding hchar[] entry.

For example, a character (its cell) can be 16x8
[wchar[cn] x (hchar[cn]/256 + (hchar[cn] & 256))] pixels in size, but
its character graphic could be 16x3 [wchar[cn] x (hchar[cn]/256)]
pixels. Clearly, we don't know at what place (height) in the cell the 
character graphic should be located. That's what the Y position is used for.
I'll give an example later.

About the 4-bit packed graphics. Previously, I used to think that each
pixel of the graphic is 8-bit (e.g. can have 256 colors). This is not
the case. The pixels are in fact 4-bit (max. 16 colors), so 2 of them are
packed into one byte.
Let's consider a graphic that's 4 pixels wide. 
I'll denote each pixel of the line with it's number: 1 2 3 4
The pixels would then be packed into 2 bytes, like this: 
21 43
||
|+-- LO nibble (val=byte & 15)
+--- HI nibble (val=byte / 16)

If we had to pack an odd number of pixels (i.e. 7), it would be done similarly:
21 43 65 x7
         ||
         |+-- Last pixel value (val=byte & 15)
         +--- Empty / Unused

Therefore, with the width of a given graphic (wchar[cn]), the total number
of bytes used to store each line is (width+1)/2

Example on how to display a character: 
Let's say we have a right arrow sign and it's a 6x6 pixels character.
Its cell would look like: 
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .

The corresponding character graphic (after unpacking) is 6x3 pixels:
. . . * . . 
* * * * * . 
. . . * . . 

We would need to place this graphic in the center of the cell to get the
entire character:
. . . . . . Y=0
. . . . . .   
. . . * . .  \  
* * * * * .   | Inserted graphic -> In this case Y=2
. . . * . .  /  
. . . . . . Y=5

That's how every character is displayed. You'll notice that some characters 
(mainly the first and the last few) don't have any graphics of their own so
they use another character's graphics.
Also, the characters are stored in normal ASCII order, so if you wanted to 
display the character 'A', for example, you would draw the character no. 65 
(ASCII code for 'A')
