You are now reading a manual which exactly describes
how to create your very own missions for Command & Conquer!!!
I wrote this manual because I noticed there are a lot of people who
are trying to create new missions, but somehow have problems with it.
So I guess it is some sort of FAQ but without the questions.


========================
What will you find here?
========================
A detailed description of how to create a mission, step by step.
But especially how to edit the INI-files. And how to make a mission
playable.


============================
What will you NOT find here?
============================
Everything about creating maps. As there are several map editors, I am
not gonna explain how they all work. Creating maps isn't that difficult
after all.

===================
1. GETTING STARTED
===================
I assume you all use some version of CCMap and Mix Manager.
Good. These are the only programs we need.

Extract a BIN and INI file as described in the docs that came with Mixman.
Depending on whether you want to create a new map or change an old one,
use CCMAP to do this. See the docs for more information.

After creating the map, you are going to need this manual badly.


=======================
2. EDITING THE INI FILE
=======================
The INI file is a textfile which acts like a kind of script. Besides telling
the game what is on the map, it also contains all the information about
which things should at what time or action. It exists of several entries
starting with a header between [ and ]. You don't have to delete any of
them if you use CCMAP.

Another thing: there is one drawback to the .ini file. If it exceeds 16K,
you'll start to miss some things from your mission. Maybe some triggers
will disappear, then some Tiberium, then some units... well, whatever's
at the end of your INI file. I always put the [Overlay] at the end, because
that causes the least problems in the mission itself.

I will now explain what's in those entries and how to change it correct.


=========
2.1 BASIC
=========
This is all about the mission itself. Here, you can change which side you
play, what movies you see and some other stuff.

[BASIC]
CarryOverCap=-1                 1
CarryOverMoney=20               2
Intro=TBRINFO1                  3
BuildLevel=8                    4
Theme=No theme                  5
Percent=100                     6
Player=GoodGuy                  7
Action=DESOLAT                  8
Lose=GDILOSE                    9
Win=HELLVALY                    10
Brief=GDI8B                     11
Name=Hellfire                   12

1: I'm not sure about this one. Could be the amount of real tiberium that
   the player takes over from the previous mission (divided by 100, probably)
   All I know about it is that it's never used. (-1 means "not used")
2: amount of credits that the player takes over from the previous mission
   divided by 100. So 10 means 1000 credits.
3: Introduction-video. Played before the briefing video. There are a lot of
   titles available. Just look at MOVIES.TXT and pick them out. An X means no
   video.
4: Has to do with what stuff you can build and your score when you win.
   This doesn't affect normal missions, but is necessary in Covert Operation
   missions. This can be 0 to 99, but it is advised only to use 1 to 98,
   as 99 allows you to build stuff like the Hospital, the Biolab, the
   civilians and the Mobile HQ.
5: Music playing. It is advised not to put anything here if you have an
   "Action" video: the movie won't play fluently anymore because C&C will
   read the movie and play the theme at the same time.
6: Not sure about this one. Some say it is the Computer's intelligence.
7: this side is controlled by the player
                GoodGuy: GDI
                BadGuy: Nod
   You can also put the following teams there, but beware: if you do that,
   C&C will CRASH when you accomplish your mission. This is because these
   teams don't have a score screen.
                Neutral: Civilians
                Special: Dinosaurs (in Covert Ops. hidden missions)
                Multi1 - Multi6: multiplayer teams
   If you say Player=Special or one of the Multi-teams (1-6) you can build
   stuff from both Nod AND GDI. When you say Player=Neutral, you won't be
   able to build anything.
8: Video played after the briefing video
9: video playing when you lose
10: video playing when you win
11: briefing video
12: mission name. This is only necessary for multiplayer missions and
    Covert Operations missions. The name can be some 33 characters in length.


============
2.2 BRIEFING
============
This part is used to give your mission a briefing text.

Although most people use the file MISSION.INI for this, you don't have to
include a MISSION.INI to get a briefing: you can just put "[BRIEFING]" in
your .INI file. Also, this briefing can't be changed by putting MISSION.INI
in your C&C directory.

Use it like this:

[BRIEFING]
1=GDI has attacked and cut off one of our bases. Find a way into
2=the base. One of our agents will assist you by placing a landing 
3=flare at the right time. Once you're in,
4=rebuild the base and destroy the GDI forces in the area.

It doesn't matter how much you write on one line, C&C will make sure it fits
in the "restate" window. You have to keep in mind that the maximum is 498
characters, spaces and line ends included, and C&C shows max. 47 characters
on each line. This also means that in this example,

"rebuild the base and destroy the GDI forces in the area."

will not necessarily appear on the next line. If you want something to
appear on the next line, you'll have to do it by adding extra spaces
between the words.


=======
2.3 MAP
=======
This part describes the map. It is best that you edit this first
before using CCMAP. This way you can determine the size of the map.
(A C&C map has a size of 64x64)

[MAP]
Height=61               1
Width=60                2
X=2                     3
Y=1                     4
Theater=WINTER          5

1: Height of the map (max 62)
2: Width of the map (max 62)
3: horizontal position of left corner of map
4: vertical position of left corner of map
5: graphics set: WINTER, DESERT, TEMPERATE

Note: you should use a border of 1 cell width around your map which you leave
empty. This is because the Antonov and A10's don't really fly off the map but
get stuck at the border. If they fly by, you will still see them sticking at
the border of the map. Funny thing is you still can shoot them!

To determine exactly where your reinforcements enter the map, you have to
make rock borders just outside the visible part of the map. Now make a hole
in this "wall" and you will be sure your reinforcements will show up there.

Now, to edit the map and still be able to make these borders, use this:

[MAP]
Height=64
Width=64
X=0
Y=0
Theater=(Whatever you're using)

==================================
2.4 GOODGUY, BADGUY, MULTI1-MULTI6
==================================
These entries are all the same and say something about the different
types of forces.

[GoodGuy]               0
FlagHome=0              1
FlagLocation=0          2
MaxBuilding=150         3
MaxUnit=250             4
Allies=GoodGuy          5
Quota=0                 6
Edge=South              7
Credits=30              8

0: team. This can be:
     GoodGuy = GDI
     BadGuy  = Nod
     Neutral = Civilians
     Special = Dinosaurs (in Covert Ops. hidden missions)
     Multi1  = Blue multiplayer team
     Multi2  = Orange multiplayer team
     Multi3  = Green multiplayer team
     Multi4  = White multiplayer team
     Multi5  = Yellow multiplayer team
     Multi6  = Red multiplayer team
1: don't know. Has something to do with the flag in multiplayer games.
2: same as above. You don't have to add these for single player scenario's.
3: originally a limit to the number of buildings (in DUNE II). Not used.
4: originally a limit to the number of units (in DUNE II). Not used.
5: this says who the friends are. You can't attack these guys in battle.
   You can insert more than one side, example Allies=GoodGuy,Neutral
   WARNING: You have to add your team to the "Allies" list of that ally,
   otherwise they won't hesitate to attack YOU.
6: unknown. In DUNE II, this was used as trigger: amount of credits to win.
   I have no idea why they put it in C&C.
7: reinforcements will come from this direction (North, East, South or West)
8: number of credits they start with divided by 100 (so 10 means 1000)

You see that there are some unknown things but they are not that important.
The only things you should change are Allies, Egde and Credits.


===========
2.5 TERRAIN
===========
These are the trees (and some of the rocks) on the map.
You don't have to worry about this. CCMAP's got it all worked out.
I can give you the explanation though.

Syntax:
        3786=T06,None
        ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^
         1    2   3

1: cellnumber
2: Name of the Terrain item. T## means tree, TC## means clump of trees.
   SPLIT2 and SPLIT3 are the blossom trees.
3: unknown. It's always "None". I DO know it's not a trigger. I tested that.

Note: The blossom tree SPLIT2 can't be used in Desert Theater.


===========
2.6 OVERLAY
===========
You don't have to worry about this. CCMAP's got it all worked out.
But if you're interested, there are a few specials that are not in CCMAP.
Again, I'll give you the syntax.

Syntax:
        2430=WOOD
        ^^^^ ^^^^
         1    2

1: cellnumber
2: Name of the Overlay type.

Here is a list of all the overlays:

[*] =   SPECIAL: Can be built on, can be walked on, but can't be built. If
        you build a building on it, the concrete bib under that building
        is covered and that cell of the building is not shown on radar: you
        only see the color of the overlay. Never used in the normal missions.
        They can be used to mark a place and work with celltriggers.

[*]     ROAD     : No road, but grey squares on the ground - looks a bit
                   like a chessboard, but only 4x4. Can be used to mark a
                   place and work with celltriggers. You can build walls
                   on this one. The wall will just replace this overlay.
[*]     CONC     : Concrete. No walls, just concrete on the ground.
                   You can build walls on them, but if you do so,
                   the CONC will be gone.
[*]     FPLS     : Flag PLacement Sign. Round sign on the ground. Looks
                   a bit like a landmine, but doesn't do anything. It is
                   used to show under the flag in "capture the flag"
                   multiplayer games. You can't build overlay on the FPLS.
        SBAG     : Sandbag wall
        CYCL     : chainlink fence
        BRIK     : Concrete wall
        BARB     : Barbwire fence
        WOOD     : Wooden fence
        TI1-TI12 : Tiberium 1 - 12

        V12      : Haystacks           \
        V13      : Haystack             | Invincible civilian buildings:
        V14      : Wheat Field          | looks like they're just a part of
        V15      : Fallow Field         | the map. Can't be attacked, not
        V16      : Corn Field           | even with [CTRL]. Only visible in
        V17      : Celery Field         | TEMPERATE/WINTER Theater.
        V18      : Potato Field        /
         \-> can be used as STEALTH BARRIERS in the DESERT theater ;)

        WCRATE   : Wooden crate: gives you money ($2000)
        SCRATE   : Steel crate (doesn't do anything - used for celltriggers)


==========
2.7 SMUDGE
==========
Well, can't remember having seen any smudges in CCMAP! These are things like
scorchmarks and bomb-craters. Not really interesting, but you can make it
look like a base has been under attack for a while when you start a mission.
You could add them manually if you want:

Syntax:
        3815=SC3,3815,0
        ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^
         1    2   3   4
1: cellnumber
2: what kind of smudge
        SC1  ... SC6  : several scorch-marks
        CR1  ... CR6  : several craters

3: Cellnumber (again) I don't know why they repeat it.
4: Always a '0'. I don't know what it means, but it's always a '0'.

I also found SQUISH in the GAME.DAT, but that didn't show anything,
so I'm not sure if it is really a smudge. I found the SHP file though.
It's a soldier crushed by a tank. It's a pity it isn't used.
I remember having seen a similar thing in Dune II.


=============
2.8 WAYPOINTS
=============
Waypoints numbers are used in the TEAMTYPE-section. They are shortcuts to
cellnumbers so you won't have to type the long cellnumbers time after time.
There are 32 waypoints (0....31) which you may define as you wish. BUT there
are 3 waypoints that have a special purpose:

   waypoint 25: the yellow flare is always lit in this cell if necessary.
   waypoint 26: this is the top-left corner of the screen at levelstart.
   waypoint 27: default dropzone for Chinook if you don't use any 'move'
                or 'unload' commands in the TEAMTYPE-section. (see later on)


Syntax:
        1=1362
        ^ ^^^^
        1   2

1: waypoint number
2: cellnumber it reflects to. '-1' means that it isn't used at all.


==============
2.9 STRUCTURES
==============
Nothing difficult about this one. Most of it is done by CCMAP. 

Syntax:
        000=BadGuy,OBLI,256,1344,0,Guard,cool
        ^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^ ^^^^^ ^^^^
         1    2     3    4   5   6  7     8

1: number
2: owner
3: building type (done with editor)
4: health. (256=100%) You can change that with CCMAP.
5: Location of this building; given by the cellnumber of the top-left
   corner of the building.
6: direction (only useful for Gun Turrets). 0=north, 32=north-east, 64=east,
   96=south-east, 128=south, 160=south-west 192=west, 224=north-west.
7: action which it is undertaking at the moment. You don't have to add it:
   it doesn't affect buildings, not even guard towers.
   (I tried "Sleep", but it didn't work. The turret still attacked me.)
8: this is a name you can make up yourself. It is used to connect the
   building to a trigger with that name. This way you can let something
   happen if anything happens to the building. (see TRIGGERS)
   Make it "None" if it isn't connected with any trigger.


==========
2.10 UNITS
==========
Almost the same story as for STRUCTURES.
These are the vehicles. You might want to edit some entries.

Syntax:
        000=BadGuy,BIKE,256,1231,0,Guard,None
        ^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^ ^^^^^ ^^^^
         1    2      3   4    5  6   7    8

1: number
2: owner
3: type of unit (done with editor). Abbreviations are as follows:
        VICE Viceroid           MCV  Mobile Construction Vehicle
        FTNK Flame Tank         JEEP Humm-Vee
        STNK Stealth Tank       BGGY Nod Buggy
        LTNK Light Tank         BIKE Recon Bike
        MTNK Medium Tank        MSAM Rocket Launcher
        HTNK Mammoth Tank       APC  APC
        MHQ  Mobile HQ          BOAT Gunboat
        LST  Hovercraft         TRIC Triceratops
        MLRS SSM-launcher       TREX Tyrannosaurus rex
        ARTY Mobile Artillery   RAPT Velociraptor
        HARV Harvester          STEG Stegosaurus
 Yes, dino's in C&C. To see them, you need the Covert Operations (C&C v1.20).
 Just start C&C by typing "C&C FUNPARK" on the command line. Then, start
 a new game and have a lot of fun killing these prehistoric monsters!

 Note: the MHQ is a heavy bastard! If it is destroyed, its owner is destroyed
       COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!!!! Just like a dozen of nuke missiles dropping on
       your head. Very cool, it's game over then.
       (used in Multiplayer: Capture the flag, Bases off.)

4: health (256=100%)
5: cellnumber
6: direction which it is facing. 0=north, 32=north-east, 64=east,
   96=south-east, 128=south, 160=south-west 192=west, 224=north-west.
7: action which it is undertaking at the moment. Choose from:
        Ambush             : Go to 'Hunt' when discovered. 
                              \-> leftover from Dune II; Not sure if it works
        Area Guard         : Keep guarding an area around the cell
        Guard              : Attack enemies who come in shooting range
        Harvest            : Only for harvesters
        Hunt               : Search the entire map for enemies to kill
        None               : No command
        Sleep              : Don't move, don't react on anything.
        Sticky             : "Sleep" until attacked twice
        Stop               : Unarmed equivalent of Guard (Harvester, MCV)
        Timed Hunt         : Go to Hunt after a random time
        Unload             : For MCVs: this makes them deploy to C.Y.
   Other existing commands are Attack, Capture, Construction, Enter, Missile,
   Move, Repair, Rescue, Return, Retreat, Sabotage and Selling, but these can't
   be used because they are either linked to special functions, or require a
   target.
8: any triggername it is connected to (make up a name yourself)
 

=============
2.11 INFANTRY
=============
These are all the people on the map.

Syntax:
        000=GoodGuy,E1,256,2343,0,Guard,0,None

   128=south, 160=south-west 192=west, 224=north-west)
9: any triggername which he is connected to. You can make up this 
   name yourself.


=================
2.12 CELLTRIGGERS
=================
Add these yourself. They are used for activating a trigger if some soldier or
unit enters this cell.

Syntax:
        143=kill
        ^^^ ^^^^
         1   2

1: cellnumber which activates this trigger
2: triggername connected to that cell (make it up yourself)

So if cell 143 is crossed, the trigger with name KILL is activated, but ONLY
if KILL is a "Player enters" trigger. (see TRIGGERS)


=============
2.13 TRIGGERS
=============
Now this is something! This is in fact THE part of the file which describes 
what is going on in your mission. A sort of script. It is a lot of work to 
describe it as exact as possible, but I'll try...

IMPORTANT: make sure you read part 3: "Trigger Examples".
They will give you a better look on the use of the triggers.

Syntax:
        kill=Player enters,Create Team,0,BadGuy,tanks,0
        ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^
         1         2            3      4    5     6   7

1: name of the trigger (the one you made up earlier)
   -> max. 4 characters.
2: what must happen so the TRIGGER will be activated?
 Choose from:
        # Bldgs Dstr.      : if specified nr of structures is destroyed.
        # Units Dstr.      : if specified number of units is destroyed.
        All Destr.         : if EVERYTHING of one side is destroyed
        Any                : only used with Cap=Win/Des=Lose
        Attacked           : if it gets attacked
        Bldgs Destr.       : if all buildings have been destroyed
        Built it           : if a specific structure was built (see 4)
        Civ. Evac.         : if civilian(s) have been evacuated
        Credits            : certain amount of credits is reached
        Destroyed          : if it has been destroyed
        Discovered         : if it has been discovered (only works with 
                             infantry, units and buildings)
        House Discov.      : if this enemy has been seen
        No Factories       : if all Construction Yards are destroyed
        None               : no activation at all
        Player Enters      : if player enters this cell/building
                             (celltriggers/buildings)      \-> captured
        Time               : if a certain amount of time has passed
        Units Destr.       : if all vehicles and soldiers are destroyed

3: what should happen if the trigger is activated?
 Choose from:
        Airstrike          : airstrikes available to the human player.
        All to Hunt        : everybody searches for the enemy
        Allow Win          : used when there is more than one goal
                             to win the mission
        Autocreate         : random create the teams specified in
                             TEAMTYPES (see TEAMTYPES part 3d)
        Cap=Win/Des=Lose   : for buildings: captured=win/destroyed=lose
        Create Team        : create a specific team (name at '6')
        Dstry Teams        : unknown. Could be: remove teamtype(s) from
                             AUTOCREATE list
        Dstry Trig 'XXXX'  : destroy trigger with name XXXX. For example:
                             you can attach XXXX to a timed Ion 
                             Cannon attack. If for example the 
                             Adv. Comm. Center is destroyed which has
                             that trigger "Dstry Trig 'XXXX'", no more
                             Ion Cannons will be fired.
        Dstry Trig 'YYYY'  : Same as XXXX, but now with YYYY
        Dstry Trig 'ZZZZ'  : Same as XXXX, but now with ZZZZ
        DZ at 'Z'          : yellow flare is lit at waypoint 25
        Ion Cannon         : For GDI: Ion Cannon available (only if you have
                                      an Advanced Communications Center)
                             For Nod: Player will be attacked with Ion Cannon
        Lose               : you lose the mission
        None               : nothing
        Reinforce.         : Send reinforcements (see 6 and TEAMTYPES)
        Win                : you win the mission
        Nuclear Missile    : For Nod: Nuke available. Only once in a mission,
                                      and only if you have a Temple of Nod
                                      (can't be launched without)
                             For GDI: Player will be attacked with a Nuke
        Production         : computer rebuilds destroyed buildings
                             specified in [BASE] section (see BASE)

4: this is a counter and can have more functions. Depending
   on your trigger action it counts : number of buildings destroyed,
   number of units destroyed, number of credits, amount of time.

   With the "Built it" action, this is the structure ID. Here is the
   list of structure ID's for the normal buildings that can be built.
 Choose from:
        TMPL = 20             PROC = 7              PYLE = 15
        EYE  = 21             SILO = 8              HAND = 19
        WEAP = 0              HPAD = 9              FIX  = 17
        GTWR = 1              HQ   = 4              SBAG = 60 (*)
        ATWR = 2              SAM  = 10             CYCL = 61 (*)
        OBLI = 3              AFLD = 11             BRIK = 62 (*)
        GUN  = 5              NUKE = 12             BARB = 63 (*)
        FACT = 6              NUK2 = 13             WOOD = 64 (*)
 (*) : I haven't tested these...but the numbers are right.

5: Which player can activate the trigger? Note that this does not determine
   which player is affected by the trigger effect.
   Examples: for "Built it": Who builds the structure?
             for "Attacked": who attacks the target?
             for "Player Enters": who entered the cell/building?
6: teamtype name connected with trigger (make up a name yourself)
7: if 0: trigger is activated only once.
   if 1: trigger is activated only once when all units/buildings with this
         trigger have been activated.
   (used in GDI missions: you get Airstrikes when all SAM's are destroyed)
   if 2: trigger is activated every time when any of the units/buildings
         with this trigger have been activated.
   -if 1 or 2: trigger keeps being activated when the number at place 4
               is reached.

Note that there are some triggers you must use, like "Win" and "Lose".


==============
2.14 TEAMTYPES
==============
Probably the most complicated part of the INI files. This part contains
a lot of unknown things. You can use some default combinations though. 
See EXAMPLES.

Syntax:
        tanks=GoodGuy,1,0,0,1,0,15,1,0,0,2,E6:5,APC:1,2,Move:5,Guard:30,0,0
        ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^
          1      2   [a b c d e f  g h i]4     5      6        7        8 9

1: teamname, defined in the TRIGGER section (place 6)
2: owner
3: Combination of numbers, always 9 of them.
   I've called them a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and i. This is what they mean:
 - a: Seems to act something like the "X" key, but links and unlinks the
      team members logically as well as physically. 1=on.
 - c: I believe to be a toggle for the "ALT" key. 1=on.
 - d: Enables Autocreate for this teamtype.
 - f: I have no idea. Changing it at random has no discernible effects.
      But note that in Westwood's .INI's there is a strong correlation
      between this number and the team's build/tech level.
 - g: The number of teams of this type that will act concurrently (i.e.,
      x,x,x,x,x,x,5,x,x,1,E2:3,1,move:2,0,0 will get you 15 grenadiers at
      waypoint 2). When this number is greater than zero, it will cause the
      team to be produced, regardless of any trigger.
 - b, e, h and i don't seem to have any function at all.

 To make this easier, I suggest you use the following 'templates':
    -> CREATE TEAM:  (will be "autocreated")
        1,0,0,1,0,15,1,0,0,
    -> REINFORCE. by APC, Chinook, hovercraft, or units coming out of the
       edge of the map:
        0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,
    -> REINFORCE. by A10 airstrike:
        1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,
4: number of unit-types, here 2: E6 (the Engineer) and APC.
5: what units and how much, here 5 Engineers and one APC.
6: number of action they will undertake, here 2
7: what actions they undertake, here 2; Move to waypoint 5 and then guard for
   a time of 30 counts.
   Contrary to popular belief, these are NOT the same as the unit commands.
   ONLY these will work:
        None:??            : (Don't do anything?)
        Move:waypoint      : Go to waypoint ...
	Move to Cell:cell? : Not sure how to use it; don't know if it works.
        Attack Base:time   : Attack enemy base (also for Engineers)
        Attack Units:time  : Attack enemy units
        Attack Civil.:time : Attack civilians ("Neutral" side)
        Attack Tarcom:??   : Unknown
        Defend Base:time   : Defend own base
        Guard:time         : Attack enemies who come in shooting range
        Loop:##actions     : The "loop" instruction does not cause looping,
                             it prevents it. All teams loop by nature.
                             "loop:N" causes the first N instructions
                             to be left out of the loop. The "loop" action
                             should be at the end of the list of actions.
        Rampage:??         : Unknown
        Retreat:??         : Unknown, in Dune II it was
                             "return to original location on the map"
        Unload:waypoint    : For Chinooks, hovercrafts and APCs used as
                             reinforcements. It makes them unload anything
                             they carry with them. Behind the ":", just
                             repeat the waypoint where he stopped/landed.
                             This doesn not work to make an MCV deploy to C.Y.
                             unless it had the Unload command at map start but
                             was moved by this teamtype before deploying.
8: This can be either "0" or "1". If this is put on "1",
   destroyed members of the team will be replaced.
9: This can be either "0" or "1".
   if "1", the team will be produced, regardless of any trigger other than
   "autocreate". A team autochthonously produced in this way will not carry
   out orders and will be repeatedly replaced upon destruction. If the team
   was produced by trigger, this "1" : will produce an inactive backup of
   the team.


   I found out that helicopters with passengers don't need the "Unload"
   command: when you only use a "Move" command, the helicopter will also
   unload its passengers and fly off the map.

   If you make a team with an APC and infantry units, and you make it come
   as reinforcements, the infantry units will automatically be IN the APC.
   The APC will NOT unload automatically. It will only unload when you
   give it the "unload" command.


=========
2.15 BASE
=========
These are the buildings that the computer player has to rebuild as a result
of the "Production" trigger. Most of the times, this trigger is connected to
a timer.

Use BaseIT to put the [base] section in your level.

Syntax:
        000=HAND,436212992
        ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
         1    2      3


1: priority number: nr. 000 will be rebuilt first, then 001, then 002 etc.
   You can change the numbers yourself if you want one specific building to
   be rebuilt before the others.
2: building type it reflects to (here: Hand of Nod)
3: This number is calculated from the coordinates: [16777216*Y + 256*X]
   The Hand of Nod coordinates can be calculated form this number:
   Y=26 and X=21. The cellnumber is [64*Y + X], here 1685.

The owner is not determined in any way: I 've once seen a Multi3 silo that
was rebuilt by GDI.  (in Jon Magne Austenaa's mission "Too much tax, GDI!")


===================
2.16 REINFORCEMENTS
===================
This part is sometimes used to control hovercraft reinforcements.
I advise you not to use it: after all, you can do this with triggers too.
If you do want to use it, you can look at some examples from the game like
GDI mission 1. I don't know how it works.

Well... I found some info about it. I'll put it here anyway.

Syntax:
        1=GoodGuy,E1,Beach,0
        ^ ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ ^
        1    2    3    4   5

1. Number
2. Owner
3. Unit type to reinforce
4. Place to reinforce. Choose from:
        North/East/South/West
        Shipping
        Beach
        Ocean
        Air
        Visible
        EnemyBase
        HomeBase
   I don't know anything more about them.
5. Don't know. I think it has something to do with the time after which
   something is reinforced. Sometimes a "+" is added behind that number.
   (maybe to loop the reinforcement??)


=============
2.17 TEMPLATE
=============
In mission SCG06EA, I found a special part named [TEMPLATE].
This part is used to modify the map in the .INI file.

[TEMPLATE] overrides the values in the map file , but it is not meant
to make a map: Making a map in the .INI file is very difficult, and
it overloads the .INI file. (see "2. EDITING THE INI FILE")
In mission SCG06EA, this was used to correct some errors (I suppose).

It works in the same way as the [OVERLAY] section:

Syntax:
        3965=W2
        ^^^^ ^^
         1   2

1: Cellnumber of the top-left corner of this template
2: what map-image you have on this place (W2 is a 2x2 square of water)
   In GAME.DAT, I found a whole list of these templates: some 220 of them!
   This is also the reason why I didn't put it here.
  

===================
3. TRIGGER EXAMPLES
===================
*** If you (BadGuy) enter cel 232, 233 or 234, the enemy should create a team
    of 2 MTNK's and 5 minigunners which move to cell 2211 and attack you:

    [CELLTRIGGERS]

*** After 150 time-units a chopper should arrive at cell 1846 and unload 5
    engineers which start capturing your base:

    [TRIGGERS]
    chop1=Time,Reinforce.,150,GoodGuy,chop,0

    [TEAMTYPES]
    chop=GoodGuy,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,2,E6:5,TRAN:1,3,Move:1,Unload:1,Attack Base:50,0,0

    [TEAMTYPES]
    a10s=GoodGuy,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,A10:4,0,0

   -Don't let the trigger end on "1": the enemy will send out 4 planes
    for EVERY BULLET you shoot at their harvester.

*** Every time when 80 time-units have passed, the enemy sends out 2 A10's
    which drop some napalm on your heads.

    [TRIGGERS]

*** Every time when 200 time-units have passed, you want the enemy to fire a
    nuclear missile.

    [TRIGGERS]
    miss=Time,Nuclear Missile,200,None,None,1

*** When three of the GDI computer player's buildings are destroyed,
    the computer player will start rebuilding its structures.

    [TRIGGERS]
    prod=# Bldgs Dstr.,Production,3,GoodGuy,None,0

*** When four specific Nod obelisks are destroyed, a GDI MCV will be
    reinforced and it will move to cell 1342.

    [STRUCTURES]
    024=BadGuy,OBLI,256,1219,0,obel
    025=BadGuy,OBLI,256,1324,0,obel

   -The "1" at the end of the trigger does not mean "repeat" here,
    but exactly the opposite: only execute the trigger when it is activated
    at every unit/structure that has the trigger.

    This kind of trigger is frequently used in the GDI missions to give
    the player Airstrike capability once all SAM-sites are destroyed.


====================================
4. HOW TO MAKE YOUR MISSION PLAYABLE
====================================
You can play the missions without messing around in the general.mix:
Just rename your mission files to the format described here.

Syntax:
        SCB01EA.BIN
         || |||  | 
    1 <--'| |||  `-> 6
      2 <-' ||`-> 5
        3 <-'`-> 4


1. The name of every mission file starts with "SC". This means "scenario".
2. Player. Choose from:
       G: Goodguy (GDI)
       B: Badguy (Nod)
       J: JP (for Funpark missions)
       M: Multi (For multiplayer maps)
3. Number of the mission it replaces (here mission 01)
4. E/W: The "W" is only used with GDI mission 4 and 5.
   This could be East/West on the map where you choose your mission.
5. A/B/C: In the game, you can sometimes choose more than one mission
   on the map. The "B" and "C" (and the "W" from 4.) don't work for
   multiplayer and Covert Operations missions.
6. BIN/INI: You always need two files: a map and a text file.
   BIN is the extension for the map file, INI for the text file.

C&C will accept your .INI and .BIN as the normal mission files, and you will
be able to play the mission.


================================
4.1 ADDING NEW COVERT OPERATIONS
================================
When you have the Covert Operations installed, you can also add missions
to the "New missions" list by giving them a mission number higher than 19
(starting from 20) that isn't already used by the Covert Ops. / Special Ops.
missions.

The available numbers are:

- For GDI:  20, 21, 24..35, 42, 49, 53..59, 64..99

- For Nod:  22..29, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42..59, 62..99

Note that for the Covert operations you can't add missions ending on EB, EC,
WA, WB or WC (See: "4. HOW TO MAKE YOUR MISSION PLAYABLE"). Only files ending
on "EA" will be accepted. The others won't appear in the "New missions" list.

Now, you have to make sure the "BuildLevel=" setting is set correctly.
This doesn't affect normal missions, but is necessary in Covert Operation
missions. This can be 0 to 99, but it is advised only to use 1 to 98,
as 99 lets you build stuff like the Hospital and Biolab, the civilians and
the MHQ.


You 'll also have to give your mission a name by puting "Name=xxx" in the
[BASIC] section, where xxx is the name you want to give it. This name can
be some 33 characters in length.

Like this:      [BASIC]
                CarryOverCap=-1
                CarryOverMoney=0
                Intro=x
                BuildLevel=12
                Theme=No theme
                Percent=100
                Player=BadGuy
                Action=SEIGE
                Win=FORESTKL
                Lose=RETRO
                Brief=x
           ->   Name=Run for your life!

As the Covert Operations don't have briefing videos, the "Action" video
is used as 'briefing'. If an added Covert Operations mission has no "Action"
video, you won't get a "VIDEO" button in the Restate window.
When you have an "Action" AND a "Brief" video, the "Brief" video will be
shown when you press "VIDEO" in the Restate window.

Note that not all video's are on the Covert Operations CD. You'll have to
choose videos you can use with Covert Operations (see MOVIES.TXT).

5. FINAL NOTES
==============
Well, I guess you should be able to create a fine mission now.
Anyway, I did it with this information!

HINT: Use the Mix Manager to extract some INI's and take a look at them.
It sure helped me with certain problems I had. And keep testing.
If you have any comment or questions about this manual, you are
welcome to send me some e-mail with the subject 'C&C MANUAL'.

6. THE 'THANKS TO' CHAPTER
==========================
I really should thank some people for giving me help and discovering lots of
information.

Andrew Griffin who actually started this all
Richard Heesbeen and Jeroen Ritmeijer for making CCMAP
Vladan Bato for making the Mix Manager
Han Brunger for making the text file I based this on
Lin Kuei Ominae, for his trigger research
Everyone else who thinks he/she deserves it ;)


GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!
